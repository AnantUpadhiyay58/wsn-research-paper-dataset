# WSN Research Paper Dataset

This repository contains datasets used for research in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), focusing on energy-efficient routing and intrusion detection systems in fog-assisted environments.

# Dataset Files

The repository includes the following CSV files:

- **`ids_dataset.csv`**  
  Contains labeled data for intrusion detection system (IDS) analysis. Each row represents a network instance with corresponding features and class labels.

- **`wsn_data_with_types.csv`**  
  Original WSN data including sensor node characteristics, types, and deployment attributes.

- **`wsn_test_data_preprocessed.csv`**  
  Preprocessed data used for testing routing algorithms.

- **`wsn_train_data_preprocessed.csv`**  
  Cleaned and normalized dataset.

# Applications

These datasets are intended for use in:
- Cyber-resilient IDS frameworks in WSN
- Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)-based routing simulation
- Energy consumption modeling
- ML/DL-based anomaly detection in fog computing environments

# Format and Usage

All files are in CSV format. They can be used directly in MATLAB.Ensure proper parsing of numeric and categorical data types.
